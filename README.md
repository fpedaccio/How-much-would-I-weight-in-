# How much would I weight in- APP
The program is capable of calculating the weight that the user enters on any planet in the solar system and some of its moons. We use the weight of the user on the earth (in KGf), which is equal to the mass of that body, to calculate gravity based on the formula Weight (in Newtons) = mass (in KG) * gravitational acceleration of the chosen planet (in m * s ^ 2). All this accompanied by a nice and nerdy user interface, which also includes some friendly reminders about physics. Like the meaning of weight and mass.
